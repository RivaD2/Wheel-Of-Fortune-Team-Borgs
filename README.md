During this week long lab, our team planned out the tasks for writing a Wheel of Fortune console application. 
We worked to:

- Create a team agreement
- Understand the MVP and all core features
- Perform Sprint Planning 
- Set up a Git Workflow 
- Create user stories and tasks based off codebase provided
- Execute the sprint
- Using OOP design principles to guide us when making code additions/decisions
- Perform a sprint retrospective
- Present our project to the cohort


MVP hit for Sprint 1:

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. Supports one player
2. Choose a string 
a. Hardcoded is fine
b. Display dashes for missing letters
3. Allow current player to guess letters
a. If letter is in the word, replace underscores with matching letters
b. If letter is not in word, let play know and keep playing
4. Allow current player to solve
